Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
says that no client should be forced to depend on method it does not use.
Split the big interface into smaller interfcaes to decide which interface should use and doesn't.

Problem : Xerox created the printer with facilities stapling,fax,photocopy,print.
			Now bcoz everything in one big class so everything needs to be called if u want to use one func.
			
Open Closed Principle (OCP):
software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification";
 that is, such an entity can allow its behaviour to be extended without modifying its source code.
